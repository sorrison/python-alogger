Declare log parsing methods here.

methods take a line of a log and return a python dict containing

----------------------------------------------
user          | string   | username
project       | string   | pid
est_wall_time | int      | estimated wall time
act_wall_time | int      | actual wall time
cpu_usage     | int      | CPU usage in seconds
queue         | datetime | 
ctime         | datetime | 
qtime         | datetime | 
etime         | datetime |
start         | datetime |
jobid	      | string   |
cores	      | int      | number of cores
jobname       | string   | Job name
exit_status   | int      | Exit status

Optional
mem           | int      | memory used
